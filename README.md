# Interactive JS Portfolio Site

This project is my attempt of completing AS2 of Web Development. 

## Code validation

I created a one page portfolio which means that all four of my pages are in one index.html. I also have a cv.html for my resume.
### Index.html
#### Errors

#### Corrected

To correct the errors shown above, i had to:
* Add missing closing brackets
* Add Ul elements to maintain correct context usage.
* Close unclosed elements
* Clean my code by using the beautify extension on Visual Studio Code, to allow me to see errors in my code easier.

### cv.html
#### Validation

After correcting index.html file,Ii made the same changes to this script. This resulted in having no errors when validating it. Additionally, I triple checked by code to prevent mistakes that i have previously gotten.

#### Validation

Although, there were no errors shown, 9 warnings did show up. To make sure that these do not progress into errors. I made sure not to over-use these elements as they are not supported on all browsers.

W3C does not have a JavaScript validator. I used another source which states that my JavaScript is valid and does not have any errors.

## Github Version Control Skill

I prefer to work on my assignment in small sections daily. This helps me to see smaller changes more significantly. This was because it is easier for me to see the differences something as small as changing the font size can make if i look at it the next day. Compared to staring at my screen for 5 hours. If i tried working on the assignment for a extensive time in a single day i felt demotivated to make my work better which is why i try to make little changes each day.
