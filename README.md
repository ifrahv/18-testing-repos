## Code validation

I created a one page portfolio which means that all four of my pages are in one index.html. I also have a cv.html for my resume.
### Index.html
#### Errors

#### Corrected

To correct the errors shown above, i had to:
* Add missing closing brackets
* Add Ul elements to maintain correct context usage.
* Close unclosed elements
* Clean my code by using the beautify extension on Visual Studio Code, to allow me to see errors in my code easier.

### cv.html
#### Validation

After correcting index.html file,Ii made the same changes to this script. This resulted in having no errors when validating it. Additionally, I triple checked by code to prevent mistakes that i have previously gotten.

Although, there were no errors shown, 9 warnings did show up. To make sure that these do not progress into errors. I made sure not to over-use these elements as they are not supported on all browsers.

W3C does not have a JavaScript validator. I used another source which states that my JavaScript is valid and does not have any errors.
